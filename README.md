**READ FIRST:**
_Ethereum is still(at the time of writing) a new technology, as are all of the tools used to develop, test
and debug dApps built on Ethereum. All of the tools used in this project are subject to frequent updates, which
will result in breaking changes to the code in this repository. Even during my time working on this project initially,
I had to frequently update my code to keep up with the blistering pace of change in the development tools at the time.
It's early days for this industry, and things are moving very fast.

The breakages will most likely occur in the code and methods used to deploy the Contracts as well as the code in the Contracts themselves. 
Getting the code in this repository to work for you will no doubt require plenty of reading of the 
relevant documentations for the various tools and libraries involved, as they will have changed, possibly significantly, since I uploaded
this code.

Unfortunately, I cannot help anyone with this individually. Keeping abreast of the relevant documentation is 
currently an absolute necessity for any developer building on Ethereum, and there is no way around that.
I wish you luck in your endeavours. Thanks for reading!_

A Blockchain-based Rating & Review Management System for E-commerce
-------------------------------------------------------------------

__Goals__:
- Design and develop a blockchain-based system which can be used to store and manage the rating
and review records generated by an online shopping platform.

- Retrieve and visualize review data stored on the blockchain. For example, simple statistical
analysis, such as, ratings received in the last week, etc.

__Abstract__:

The value of e-commerce is growing year after year. With evidence that reviews and ratings are
heavily influencing customer purchases, reviews are clearly a very valuable asset. E-commerce sites
have total control over the content and visibility of the review data in their private databases.
There exist the means, motive and opportunity to fake, edit or even delete review and rating
data. From the consumer perspective, this is a problem of trust. How can they trust that they
are reading authentic, unmodified reviews?
In order to demonstrate the ability of the blockchain to provide robust and reasonable solutions
to this problem of trust, a decentralised application was developed on the Ethereum blockchain,
to manage the rating and review data of the sort generated by an e-commerce site.
